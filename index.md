A Monthly unlearning space for me to record what I am reading each month.
Data Sistern, is about discovering data feminist approaches to data science and AI.

I was inspired by a reading group created at my workplace to explore more and share with friends.

So lets unlearn !

### Previous reading and reviews 

I will add reviews of my main takeaways !

# Data Feminism by Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein
The principles taught within this book; 
1. Data feminism begins by analyzing how power operates in the world
2. Data feminism commits to challenging unequal power structures and working toward justice
3. Data feminism teaches us to value multiple forms of knowledge, including the knowledge that comes from people as living, feeling bodies in the world
4. Data feminism requires us to challenge the gender binary, along with other systems of counting and classification that perpetuate oppression
5. Data feminism insists that the most complete knowledge comes from synthesizing multiple perspectives, with priority given to local, Indigenous, and experiential ways of knowing
6. Data feminism asserts that data are not neutral or objective. They are the products of unequal social relations, and this context is essential for conducting accurate, ethical analysis
7. The work of data science, like all work in the world, is the work of many hands. Data feminism makes this labor visible so that it can be recognized and valued
Organize against oppression
