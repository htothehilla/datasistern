# Welcome 

My name is Hillary, welcome to Data sistren.

Data Sistern, is about discovering intersectional feminist approaches to data in the digital age.

I am documenting what I am [reading](https://htothehilla.github.io/datasistern/reading.html) and what I have [read](https://htothehilla.github.io/datasistern/read.html) on this github page. You are welcome to join along. 

I have also included some introductionary learning [resources](https://htothehilla.github.io/datasistern/learning.html) that will help if you are new data, data science and AI. 

So lets discover.
